Frontend React.JS Coding Challenge: build a simple e-commerce application.

Challenge objectives:

1. Develop a simple build system for your application
2. Develop the “Add/Remove to Bag” and “Add/Remove to Wishlist” actions which --work con client side only
3. Develop a product listing pagination with 6 products per page.
The bag in the header must be updated with the new quantities and the new total price
4. Build a mini-bag with convenient actions, coherent with design.
5. Make the application responsive
6. Use CSS preprocessors
7. Use of linting tools
8. Unit testing

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test:cypress`

Runs the app in development mode and launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode with Cypress inteterface. 

### `npm run lint`

Runs ES6 linter to check the code on any ts and tsx files for syntax errors and highlight errors to make sure we can quickly find and fix them.

### `npm run pretty`

Reunst Prettier which enforces a consistent style by parsing our code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary. This command will execute prettier in all of our files in the project

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
the app is ready to be deployed!


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
